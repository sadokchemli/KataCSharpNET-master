So we are advancing well in our development, nice job :0 . It is time to add some troops into our game play.
Troops are tricky little thing our game can have troops which can be produced with blue or black elixir.
In order to produce troops you will have to have some training camps (training camps are buiddings responsible for producing your troops).
Training camps can be of 2 types 
	- "BlueTrainingCamp" which can train the following troops consuming blue elixir resources : Bomber, Giant and Miner
	- "BlackTrainingCamp" which can train the following consuming black elixir resources : Dragon
	
Each unit has offensive and defensive hitpoints as described bellow:
 - "Dragon" | OffensiveHitpoints: 7500 | DefensiveHitpoints: 5000 |
 - "Giant"  | OffensiveHitpoints: 3000 | DefensiveHitpoints: 4500 |
 - "Miner"  | OffensiveHitpoints: 1200 | DefensiveHitpoints:  800 |
 - "Bomber" | OffensiveHitpoints:  800 | DefensiveHitpoints:  350 |


 Question 1:
  - Based on the information provided above please complete the implementation of the units : Dragon,Bomber,Giant and Miner
  in order to pass all tests included in under the namespace: "ClashOfClansTest.Exercise_2.Q1"
  - Feel free to describe your solution and what are you planning to do.
  - Very important: You are not allowed to change the tests, the purpose of the exercise is to complete the implementation and 
  make the tests valid
 
 * Estimated time: 5-10 minutes *

 Question 2:
	When a unit takes a hit his life (DefensiveHitpoints) are decresing based on the offensiveHitpoint of the attack.
	When the unit Defensive Hitpoints are equal to 0 or fall bellow 0 the unit emits a last message shout before dyning .
	Each unit has a special shout message which it emits when is dying:
	  - "Dragon" - "I WILL RISE AGAIN FROM THE ASHES"
	  - "Giant"  - "OUR IRON FISTS WILL BE REMEMBERED FOREVER"
	  - "Bomber" - "WHEN YOU play with Explosives is dangerous bussiness"
	  - "Miner"  - "we return in the ground"
  
  Your role is to finish the implementation of the "ReceiveHit" method for all units in order to pass all tests 
  included in unde the namespace: "ClashOfClansTest.Exercise_2.Q1"
    
 * Estimated time: 5-10 minutes *

 Question 3:
	You arrived at a step where you have implemented quite a few things. Is there something you would have done differrent or you would want to
	refactor ? Explain your ideas and suggestions.
	
	- Add Base Class Unit
	- Add LastMessageBeforeDying property Unit that will be inherited by children classes because the message is a member of class
	- Add a constant variable for message value to facilate update

	Implement them.

 * Estimated time: 5-15 minutes *
