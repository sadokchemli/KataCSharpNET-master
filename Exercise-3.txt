Now that we have our troop units ready is time to see some action.

Each unit has the ability to move around the map in different ways.
The map is splited in equaly divided space units.
There are 3 types of movement behaviours:
	- Walk - when a unit walks it can cover 3 map spaces in 1 second
	- TunnelUnder - when a unit tunnels under it can cover 5 map spaces in 1 second
	- Fly - when a unit flies it can cover 8 map spaces in 1 second

Our troop units movement type is the following:
	- Bomber => Walk
	- Giant  => Walk
	- Dragon => Fly
	- Miner  => TunnelUnder

Question 1:
    - Provide the code implementation of the Move action for each of the troop units above
	- All tests included into the namespace "ClashOfClansTest.Exercise_3.Q1" should pass

* Estimated time: 5-15 minutes *

Question2:
	- We have decided that the bomber moves too slow so we want him to run :)
	- Implement the Run behaviour : when a unit runs it can cover 6 map spaces into one second
	- All tests included into the namespace "ClashOfClansTest.Exercise_3.Q2" should pass

* Estimated time: 5-10 minutes *
