We are going to build a game. No game knowldege needed to resolve the exercises :)

As with most of the games the essential need are resources.
We have several type of resources : gems, gold, blue elixir and black elixir.
The purpose of our first exercise is to validate our black elixir production formula. Our black elixir is extracted from
deep inside earth by greedy dwarfs and they are not happy if we do not pay the correct price.

The rules are simple:
	- For producing black elixir two other resources are needed gems and blue elixir
	- The formula states that for producing 100 units of black elixir we need 5 gems and 200 units  of blue elixir
	  or 2 gems and 500 units of blue elixir
	- If quantity of gems supplied is bellow 2 gems or 200 units of blue elixir the dwarfs are not happy 
	- If the quantities suplied are not the exact ones (or exact multiplication of them) the dwars are also not happy they 
	do not like complex computations and will ask you to pay the exact price
	- BlackElixir is produced by BlackElixirFactory building

The purpose of the exercise:
	- write all tests defined in the "WhenProducingBlackElixir.cs" based on the information provided above 
	- the code which should be covered by tests is found in "BlackElixirFactory.cs"
	- are all the tests defined enough to cover all cases ?  if not please complete with the missing tests

* Estimated time: 5-10 minutes *
